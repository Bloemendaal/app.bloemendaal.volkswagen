Connect your Volkswagen to Homey and integrate your car seamlessly into your smart home. Monitor real-time data like battery level, range, and door status directly from your Homey dashboard. Set up intelligent automations based on your car's state—for example, turn on your driveway lights when you arrive home, or get notified when charging is complete.

Control your car remotely by setting charge limits, honking and flashing lights to locate it, or waking it up for fresh data. This app works with Volkswagen vehicles equipped with We Connect or We Connect ID across Europe.
